Preface to the First Edition

\begin{itemize}
  \item The modern convention of using macrons (\=a, \=o)
    instead of apices (\'a, \'o).
  \item The intention of making this document a quick reference
    for common Latin forms, and not an exhaustive compendium
  \item Also this dictionary is not meant to be a guide for the
    early beginner, but for one who already has a rudimentary
    grasp of the language.
  \item The core of the text comes from Wheelock and Molinarius
  \item Basically once I encounter something twice in my readings,
    it gets added until I feel like the text is a somewhat
    complete reference
  \item The intention is for this to be useful for me, and if others
    find it useful as well, then I'll feel like I've accomplished
    something.
\end{itemize}
